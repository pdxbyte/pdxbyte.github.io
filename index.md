#Meeting format

* Announcements
* Beginner talk
* Short break
* Intermediate to advanced talk

##Beginner talk

Hello World! A lot of experienced programmers feel like beginners with C even if they used it in school if they haven't used it extensively since then. Students, and people who might need a refresher should both feel comfortable in this part of the meeting.

##Announcements

The second part of the meeting will have a set start time such that people can skip the first talk. Announcements include telling people about projects they are looking to collaborate with, upcoming events, and "We're Hiring".

##Intermediate to advanced talk

Could be almost anything. Starting a new hobby operating system? Programming spin control on a rocket? Writing a fast paced 3d video game? Bootstrapping bare metal via a JTAG debugger? We'd love to hear about it.
